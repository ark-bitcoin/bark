Unified Mailbox
===============

_(Note that most of this document describes planned features that are not
available yet)_

The Unified Mailbox is an optional feature of the bark server. It allows users to
more easily get notified of events happening that are relevant for their bark wallet.

The mailbox gives privacy from the public, but not from the Ark server. When you
use the mailbox, the server will be able to link all your Ark activity
together, but none of the parties you transact with will be able to link any of
your other payments.

Features include:

- receiving arkoor payments
- receiving BOLT-11 invoice payments
- receiving BOLT-12 invoice requests
- receiving new VTXOs after a non-interactive hArk refresh
- creating arkoor addresses with a blinded mailbox ID
