- Bark's `pay_lightning_invoice` is made non-blocking. It will ask Server to
  initiate payment but won't wait for settlement. To check payment progress,
  `check_lightning_payment` should now be used, optionally with wait=true
  argument. `pay_lightning_offer` and `pay_lightning_address` are also affected
