- Restore round event replay for new subscribers
  Clients subscribing to round events now receive the current Attempt event,
  allowing them to join rounds during the signup phase. This fixes a
  regression where clients waking from push notifications would miss the
  Attempt event. Empty rounds no longer replay stale events.
