- Add delegated maintenance and refresh APIs to `Wallet`:
  - `maintenance_delegated`
  - `maintenance_with_onchain_delegated`
  - `maybe_schedule_maintenance_refresh_delegated`
  - `refresh_vtxos_delegated`
  - `join_next_round_delegated`
  These methods return immediately with a pending movement that can be tracked
  via `sync()` for completion status.

- Add `--delegated` flag to `maintain` and `refresh` commands
  Allows non-blocking maintenance and refresh operations that return immediately.
  Users can track progress by monitoring movement status via `history` command.
