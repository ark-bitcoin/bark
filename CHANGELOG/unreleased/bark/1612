- Refactor wallet code to extract functionality into dedicated modules
  Board, lightning send, lightning receive, and round balance functions have been moved from
  the main `lib.rs` into their respective modules (`board.rs`, `lightning/pay.rs`,
  `lightning/receive.rs`, and `round.rs`), improving code organization and modularity.
