- Persist server pubkey and detect if it changes
  The wallet now stores the server's public key on first connection and verifies it on subsequent
  connections. If the server pubkey changes unexpectedly, the wallet will refuse to interact with
  the server and suggest the user manually exit their VTXOs. This protects against accidentally
  connecting to a different or compromised server.
