- Run all maintenance tasks regardless of error
  Previously when you ran any maintenance method, and an error was produced, the maintenance would early-out so some
  steps such as the maintenance refresh never ran. This behavior has been changed so that errors will be logged but the
  methods will not early-out. If an error does occur then an `anyhow::Error` will still be returned, however the full
  maintenance procedure will be attempted.

- Progress exits when any maintenance method is called
  Previously the exit system would be synced but no TRUC packages would be produced or broadcast. Now, bark will attempt
  to progress each exit each time a maintenance method is called.
