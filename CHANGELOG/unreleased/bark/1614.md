- Optimize `build_refresh_participation` to reduce allocations and database reads
  [#1614](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1614)
  - `build_refresh_participation` now checks if `VtxoRef` items can optionally provide
    the `Vtxo` directly, avoiding redundant database lookups
  - Internal implementation reduces memory allocations by pre-allocating vectors
- Add `RefreshStrategy::should_refresh_exclusive` and `RefreshStrategy::should_refresh_if_must`
  variants for more granular VTXO refresh filtering
  [#1614](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1614)
  - `should_refresh_exclusive`: matches VTXOs that _should_ refresh but excludes those that
    _must_ refresh
  - `should_refresh_if_must`: only matches VTXOs (both _must_ or _should_) if at least one
    VTXO meets the _must_ refresh criteria
- Add dust VTXO detection to refresh criteria
  VTXOs with amounts below P2TR dust threshold are now flagged for refresh.
