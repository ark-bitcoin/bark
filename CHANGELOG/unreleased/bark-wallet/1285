- store lightning receive payment hash and preimage as hexes instead
  of strings. This also fixes a bug preventing any lightning receive
  deletion.
  [#1285](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1285)
- remove `preimage_revealed_at is NULL` filter when fetching pending
  lightning receive. This was preventing us from claiming again after
  first claim if anything bad happened
  [#1285](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1285)
- return earlier in `check_lightning_receive` when we already got our
  htlc VTXOs. This saves us one useless gRPC call to the server
