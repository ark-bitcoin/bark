- Rework ExitVtxo to remove the VTXO-marking step
  [#1414](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1414)
- Fix a bad bug with HTLCs that must be exited but never are
  [#1414](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1414)
- Syncing and progressing in the exit system is split up how it was originally intended
  Syncing is controlled by the library user, it won't happen automatically when calling progress_exits anymore.
  [#1414](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1414)
- No longer store the entire VTXO for every exit every time we load the wallet
  Should result in a better memory footprint when the wallet contains or performed unilateral exits.
  [#1414](https://gitlab.com/ark-bitcoin/bark/-/merge_requests/1414)
- Make sure we don't accidentally spend user funds during sync_exits if their transaction falls out of the mempool
  The previous behaviour would have allowed a unilateral exit to go from AwaitingDelta -> Processing which could have
  resulted in funds being spent when new CPFP packages are created.
