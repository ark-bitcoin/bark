- entire rewrite of how round state is kept internally
  - should be more stable generally
  - can sign up to a round and make round progress asynchronously
  - input VTXOs are locked at signup to the round
  - output VTXOs are made available as soon as we have signed funding tx
  - round state is only fully cleared when the funding tx deeply confirms or all failed rounds
	are unlikely to ever confirm

- rename some lightning methods to be more consistent
  - `send_lnaddr` -> `pay_lightning_address`
  - `pay_offer` -> `pay_lightning_offer`
  - `send_lightning_payment` -> `pay_lightning_invoice`
  - `check_and_claim_all_open_ln_receives` -> `try_claim_all_lightning_receives`
  - `check_and_claim_ln_receive` -> `try_claim_lightning_receive`
