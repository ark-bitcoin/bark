- entire rewrite of how round state is kept internally
  - should be more stable generally
  - can sign up to a round and make round progress asynchronously
  - input VTXOs are locked at signup to the round
  - output VTXOs are made available as soon as we have signed funding tx
  - round state is only fully cleared when the funding tx deeply confirms or all failed rounds
	are unlikely to ever confirm
