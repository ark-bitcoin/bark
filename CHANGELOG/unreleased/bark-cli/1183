- The `bark ln claim` command now accepts an optional `--token` argument, allowing you to
  provide a Lightning receive token to receive via Lightning even if you do not have any
  existing VTXOs in the Ark. This acts as an anti-denial-of-service measure for the Ark
  server which can be optionally enforced by the server. Tokens will be distributed by
  integrators or directly by the Ark operator.
