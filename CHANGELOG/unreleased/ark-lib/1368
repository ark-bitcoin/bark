- Created a new `challenges` module to centralize VTXO ownership challenge types.
  Challenge implementations for round attempts and Lightning receives have been moved
  from `rounds` and `lightning` modules to this new module.
  `VtxoOwnershipChallenge` was renamed to `RoundAttemptChallenge` to better describe
  its usage. A `VtxoStatusChallenge` type was introduced for usage with the upcoming
  VTXO status endpoint to authenticate queries.
