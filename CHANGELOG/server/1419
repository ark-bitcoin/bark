- Added `invoice_expiry` config option to set the duration after which a
  generated invoice expires (corresponds to the BOLT 11 `expiry` field).
  Defaults to 48 hours.

- Added `receive_htlc_forward_timeout` config option to set the duration the
  server will hold inbound HTLC(s) while waiting for a user to claim a
  lightning receive. After this timeout the server will fail the HTLC(s) back
  to the sender and cancel the hold invoice. Defaults to 30 seconds.

- Removed `htlc_subscription_timeout` config option.

- The server now cancels pending lightning receive subscriptions and hold
  invoices upon invoice expiry if there is no ongoing inbound payment,
  freeing up resources.
