description = "A simple REST API for barkd, a wallet daemon for integrating bitcoin payments into your app over HTTP. Supports self-custodial Lightning, Ark, and on-chain out of the box.  barkd is a long-running daemon best suited for always-on or high-connectivity environments like nodes, servers, desktops, and point-of-sale terminals.  The API is organized into the following groups:  - **Wallet:** The bread and butter for most applications. Manage Ark addresses, balances, VTXOs, and refreshes. Send payments via Ark, Lightning, and on-chain, all funded from your Ark balance. Start here. - **Lightning:** Create BOLT11 invoices to receive payments over Lightning and track receive status. Any application that accepts Lightning payments will use these endpoints alongside the wallet endpoints. - **On-chain:** Manage barkd's built-in on-chain bitcoin wallet. This wallet holds funds in standard UTXOs, separate from your Ark balance, and operates under the normal on-chain trust model without involving the Ark server. - **Boards:** Move on-chain bitcoin onto the Ark protocol to start making off-chain payments. - **Exits:** Unilaterally move bitcoin back on-chain without server cooperation, for when the Ark server is unavailable or uncooperative. - **Bitcoin:** Query bitcoin network data such as the current block height.  All endpoints return JSON. Amounts are denominated in satoshis."
