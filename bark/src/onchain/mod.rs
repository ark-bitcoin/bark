//! Onchain wallet integration interfaces.
//!
//! This module defines the traits and types that an external onchain wallet must
//! implement to be used by the library. The goal is to let integrators plug in
//! their own wallet implementation, so features like boarding (moving onchain funds
//! into Ark) and unilateral exit (claiming VTXOs onchain without server cooperation)
//! are supported.
//!
//! Key concepts exposed here:
//! - [Utxo], [LocalUtxo] & [SpendableExit]: lightweight types representing wallet UTXOs and
//!   spendable exit outputs.
//! - [PreparePsbt] & [SignPsbt]: funding and signing interfaces for building transactions.
//! - [GetBalance], [GetWalletTx], [GetSpendingTx]: read-access to wallet state for balance
//!   and [Transaction] lookups required by various parts of the library.
//! - [MakeCpfp]: CPFP construction interfaces used for create child transactions.
//! - [ExitUnilaterally]: a convenience trait that aggregates the required capabilities a
//!   wallet must provide to support unilateral exits.
//!
//! A reference implementation based on BDK is available behind the `onchain_bdk`
//! cargo feature. Enable it to use the provided [OnchainWallet] implementation.

	///
	/// # Arguments
	///
	/// * `tx` - A parent `Transaction` that is guaranteed to have one P2A output which
	///          implementations must spend so that both the parent and child transactions can be
	///          broadcast to the network as a v3 transaction package.
	/// * `fees` - Informs the implementation how fees should be paid by the child transaction. Note
	///            that an effective fee rate should be calculated using the weight of both the
	///            parent and child transactions.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// Returns a `Result` containing:
	/// * `Transaction` - The signed CPFP transaction ready to be broadcasted to the network with
	///                   the given parent transaction if construction and signing were successful.
	/// * `CpfpError` - An error indicating the reason for failure in constructing the CPFP
	///                 transaction (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid parent transaction, or
	///                 signing failure).
